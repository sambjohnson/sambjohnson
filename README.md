I am a postdoctoral scholar studying neuroscience and AI.
I am a member of Jason Yeatman's Brain and Education lab (http://brainandeducation.com).
Current projects involve applying CNN's to large neuroimaging datasets.
I also have interests in pure AI: reinforcement learning, attention, Riemannian / information geometry, and a dyanmical systems view of ANN's.
