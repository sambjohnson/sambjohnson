I am a postdoctoral scholar studying neuroscience and AI as part of Jason Yeatman's Brain and Education lab (http://brainandeducation.com).
Current projects involve applying convolutional networks to large neuroimaging datasets.
I also have interests in fundamental AI: reinforcement learning, attention mechanisms, information geometry, and a dyanmical systems view of ANN's.
