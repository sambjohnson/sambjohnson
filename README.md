I am a postdoctoral scholar studying neuroscience and AI.
I am a member of Jason Yeatman's Brain and Education lab.
Current projects involve applying CNN's to neural images.
I also have interests in pure AI: reinforcement learning, attention, Riemannian / information geometry, and a dyanmical systems view of ANN's.
